      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a participant in human rights activism and an expectant father :)</p>
      <h1>I am from San Diego, CA</h1>
      <p> I have lived and worked in Southern California throughout my entire life.</p>
      <h1>My favorite hobbys include body building and video games.</h1>
      <p>I have spent most of my life training for sports and military service, so body building has grown to be a great source of relief for me as an individual.</p>
      <h1>My dream job is to work for a major tech company or anything involving Elon Musk</h1>
      <p>I have a fascination with the prospects that the growing technology industry can provide to our people all over the world. Creating sources of connectedness, growth and compassion</p>
      <h1>I currently live in San Diego, CA</h1>
      <p>I live in an apartment in the Carmel Valley suburb of the city of San Diego itself.</p>
      <h1>I want to be a web developer so that I can enjoy a career that is immersed in community based problem solving.</h1>
      <p>I have grown up with the internet at my fingertips. Most things that I have enjoyed in my life have been aided by the work of web developers and having the opportunity to possibly be a part of that and contribute to someone else's enjoyment or fulfillment really keeps me motivated to see this through.</p>
